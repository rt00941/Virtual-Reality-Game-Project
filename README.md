# Virtual-Reality-Game-Project
For the following course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/making-virtual-reality-game?specialization=virtual-reality

My game is about interacting with the tour guide in the scene and also moving around the environment using the teleport points. To use the scene you should have an android phone with API 19 or higher that can run cardboard. Also the latest LTS version of Unity, 2019.4.3f1 has been used to make this application so that should be used to run it. Once you open the project, open 'MyScene' from Assets>Scenes, add it in build settings and build and run it for android with your phone connected to the computer. You can also use the foresttour.apk to run it directly on your phone by copying the file to your phone and installing and running it. If you want to run it on something else besides cardboard you can change the settings in the player. Once the scene opens on your device you can move around it by gazing at the white teleport points and holding your gaze for 2 seconds. You will then be teleported to the new location. Near each teleport point is a butterfly that will spin when you gaze at it for a second and stop spinning when you gaze at it again.
